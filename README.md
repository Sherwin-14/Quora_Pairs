# Quora Duplicate Question Pairs

This project tackles the challenge of identifying duplicate question pairs on Quora, a popular Q&A platform. As part of a Kaggle competition, I developed a machine learning model using XGBoost to classify duplicate question pairs. The model was trained on a large dataset of question pairs, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to capture semantic similarities. A user-friendly web application was created using Shiny to demonstrate the model's capabilities, allowing users to input question pairs and receive predictions on their similarity.
